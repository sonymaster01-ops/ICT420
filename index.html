                <p>
                    I am from a small town in northeast Ohio called Upper Sandusky.
                    I lived there for about eighteen years until I moved to Lexington
                    I have two bulldogs back home named Diesel and Tank. (insert photo(s))
                    I currently travel the country doing low voltage contruction work, all
                    while being a student at UK and a member of the Kentucky National Guard.

                    These are just a few, but I have seen a lot while working on the road!
                    I have been to many other cities, but these are the ones that I have spent
                    the most time in. I have been to a lot of different states, but I have not
                    been to all of them yet.

                <h3> Where I Want to Go</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to visit outside of the country, as I have never been!
                    I have always wanted to go to Europe, and I have a few places in mind that I
                    would like to visit. I have always wanted to go to Norway, as my family roots originate
                    from there. I have also always wanted to go to Italy, as I have heard that
                    it is beautiful and I also have a friend in the Air Force who is stationed there.
