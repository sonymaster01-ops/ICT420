                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p>
                I am from a small town in northeast Ohio called Upper Sandusky.
                I lived there for about eighteen years until I moved to Lexington
                I have two bulldogs back home named Diesel and Tank. (insert photo(s))
                I currently travel the country doing low voltage contruction work, all
                while being a student at UK and a member of the Kentucky National Guard.
