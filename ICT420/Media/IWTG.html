        <h1> Where I Want to Go</h1>
        <p>
            I have always wanted to visit outside of the country, as I have never been!
            I have always wanted to go to Europe, and I have a few places in mind that I
            would like to visit. I have always wanted to go to Norway, as my family roots originate
            from there. I have also always wanted to go to Italy, as I have heard that
            it is beautiful and I also have a friend in the Air Force who is stationed there.

            <h2>Destinations on My Bucket List</h2>
            <p>
                I've always had a deep interest in European destinations. I am particularly drawn to Norway because of my family's roots there. I have heard stories of the beautiful landscapes, the Northern Lights, and the rich Viking history that makes Norway a place I would love to experience firsthand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another place on my list is Italy. With its stunning architecture, world-famous cuisine, and rich history, it's a country I've always dreamed of visiting. I also have a close friend stationed in Italy with the Air Force, and I would love to visit her while exploring the beautiful cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice.

            <h3>Other Countries I'd Love to Explore</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Japan:</strong> Fascinated by its culture, technology, and food, Japan's blend of tradition and modernity makes it an exciting destination. ((I am also a very huge fan of animes and manga created in Japan as well!!))</li>
                <li><strong>Australia:</strong> I've heard incredible things about the wildlife, the Great Barrier Reef, and the lifestyle in Australia. I see all the time on Tiktok about spiders, and some people even having kangaroos as pets! I find that crazy!</li>
                <li><strong>New Zealand:</strong> I know it is a little cliche, but I have been following a group of people who stream on Twitch and record on YouTube, and they are originally from New Zealand. I don't know much but I would love to learn more.</li>
                <li><strong>Spain:</strong> I would love to explore Spain as well. I have heard of it's vibrant culture, along with the cities of Barcelona and Madrid. I have some friends who are originally from Spain, and might take a trip once I graduate!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                While these are just a few of the destinations I'm eager to visit, I believe traveling is a lifelong adventure. Each place offers a new perspective, and I look forward to experiencing the beauty and culture of these countries in the future.

            Traveling isn't just about the places, but it's about the stories, the people you meet, and the moments that stay with you forever. I can't wait to cross these destinations off my list and create lasting memories in every new place I explore.
